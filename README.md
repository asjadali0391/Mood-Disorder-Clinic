## Project Overview

This project applies machine learning techniques to assist in diagnosing mood disorders using survey data from 240 patients. The dataset includes responses to various psychological and behavioral indicators.

The team developed and evaluated four classification models:
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Extra Trees Classifier

After data cleaning and feature engineering, five key features emerged as the most predictive of mood disorders:
- Mood Swings
- Sexual Activity
- Sadness
- Euphoria
- Optimism

Among all models, Random Forest and Extra Trees achieved the highest accuracy (100%) on the test set. Based on its performance and interpretability, the Random Forest model is recommended as a potential decision support tool for clinical use.

**Note:** The model is not intended to replace professional medical diagnosis. It should be used alongside expert evaluation and with further validation.
